**Process**

Even though the Boids Algorithm code can be found from the "Resources".

+ add updating loop scriped I made before. Link: https://github.com/TYongK/GH_Timer

+ add random point generation on the mesh, generated from the boundary curve.

+ and measure the shortest distance between curve (wall) and boids to change the velocity of the boids when they are close to the wall.

**Resources**.
